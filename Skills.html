                <h2>2023 – C++</h2>
                    <p>
                        I began learning C++ in <strong>COS 132 – Imperative Programming</strong> and 
                        <strong>COS 110 – Program Design</strong>. These modules introduced me to the 
                        fundamentals of programming, problem solving, and object-oriented design. 
                        I gained experience with <em>types, arrays, control structures, classes, 
                        inheritance, polymorphism, memory management, and data structures</em> 
                        like stacks and queues.  
                        Later, in <strong>COS 214 – Software Modelling</strong>, I learned to 
                        use C++ in modelling complex software systems with design patterns and 
                        reusable structures.  
                        C++ remains a core language for strengthening my logic and programming foundations.

                    <p>
                        I was introduced to Python in <strong>WTW 152 – Mathematical Modelling</strong>.  
                        While we didn’t go very deep into Python itself, I used it as a tool for 
                        <em>difference equations, curve fitting, and linear programming</em>.  
                        Applications were drawn from real-life problems in <em>finance, economics, and ecology</em>.  
                        This experience showed me how programming integrates with scientific and 
                        mathematical problem solving, and gave me exposure to applying Python in 
                        practical, modelling-focused contexts.

                        <p>
                            I started learning Java in <strong>COS 212 – Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>, 
                            where I worked with advanced data structures such as <em>trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs</em>. 
                            I also studied <em>sorting, searching, and traversal algorithms</em>, comparing their efficiency and 
                            implementation in Java.  
                            In <strong>COS 226 – Concurrent Systems</strong>, I explored the fundamentals of 
                            <em>multithreading, synchronization, and program correctness in concurrent environments</em>.  
                            Java became the language where I learned how to design efficient, scalable, and concurrent programs.

                    <p>
                        Through <strong>COS 216 – Netcentric Computer Systems</strong>, I learned the 
                        fundamentals of modern web development. I worked with <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                        and Python</strong>, understanding both <em>client-side and server-side development</em>.  
                        The module also introduced concepts of <em>cloud storage, mobile platforms, 
                        data synchronization, and virtualization</em>, preparing me for full-stack development.  
                        This was my entry into building dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications.

                    <p>
                        In <strong>COS 221 – Introduction to Database Systems</strong>, I learned how to 
                        model and manage databases conceptually and relationally.  
                        We used <strong>MariaDB</strong> for practical work, exploring <em>SQL queries, 
                        relational algebra, functional dependencies, normal forms, indexing, and 
                        transaction processing</em>.  
                        This gave me practical skills in designing and querying relational databases, 
                        as well as understanding the principles behind modern data management systems.
